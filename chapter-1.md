# Chapter 1

Okay, I'm now pasting a bunch of stuff. I want to see how it feels as a text editor.

### Synopsis

Al, a young deity who has just finished building his first planet - an idyllic pastoral utopia inhabited by peaceful humans, flora and fauna - decides he wants to live among his people for a time to fully experience his children’s beauty and ingenuity, as seen from the lens of a human. But when the normally peaceful plants and animals begin to turn carnivorous and aggressive, it becomes apparent that Al’s presence on his little planet is causing unhealthy imbalances in an otherwise balanced system.

In a naive gesture of goodwill, Al gives his children the gift of Bands, a subtle form of glyph based magic that can protect them from the increasingly aggressive ecosystem, and bids farewell to his people. Over time, and without Al’s direct guidance, the people become masters of Bands, discovering loopholes in the system which unlock access to limitless magical powers - powers much larger than Al originally had in mind.

As opposing political structures form and their armies, lead largely by the most skilled and powerful Designants of the Bands, clash in a decades-long epic planetwide war that rends their continent in two, Al comes to the unsettling realization that this monstrous imbalance toward destruction is entirely his own fault. And he must figure out how to stop the momentum of this antithetical force before it takes on a life of its own.

### Project Summary

D.W. Sheppard began writing books in _The Rebalancing_ series in 2005 with the book [_Banded_](https://github.com/dwsheppard/banded). The central character plot arc revolves around the Almighty \(Al\), the deity of the planet where all of the books are set. Because the scale of time across the entire history of the world is so vastly large, Al's story is not told directly, but is told through peripheral stories that capture snaphots of Al's growth across each era. There are eight chronological eras within _The Rebalancing_ series, each with a distinct flavor and magic system. Because of the variance between each era, D.W. Sheppard is able to write any kind of book in any kind of setting. From mystery, to high fantasy, to cyberpunk, to paranormal fiction - there's a place in this timeline for it - allowing for each entry in the interconnected world to tell one small piece of Al's overall story.

### Eras in _The Rebalancing_ Series

#### Era One - Age of Al

Al cannot stand being separate from his creation. He loves his children and he loves his people, so lives among them in what is now called the Age of Al. He helps them learn, grow and thrive in their world. He meddles and tweaks things as he sees what’s important to his children.

#### Era Two - Age of Bands

Al gives His children Bands; a tangible way to access and mildly manipulate the rules of the world. He does this to help them combat the monsters. Effectively, the Bands are created to help them push back against the rising tide of the Antithesis’ influence, but they and Al are unaware of the balancing force as of yet. Al’s children become masters of the Bands.

#### Era Three - Age of Designation

The people discover loopholes in the system and the Antithesis escalates to match his children’s power with dark equivalents of his own. The Namers have fractured into two camps and have become overly powerful from leveraging loopholes in the Bands, namely “people Banding.” There is a planet wide war of epic proportions. The continent is rent in two and many cities are razed as entire land masses are shifted, destroyed and created. Edemere, the city of the Namers, is crushed and Al revokes all access to the Bands/Designation.

#### Era Four - Age of Enlightenment

Al can’t leave the good of his children without help through this horrible transition point, so gives them access to his power in a very subtle way. They must meditate and live by The Tenets to be able tap into an information highway of sorts. The closer they adhere to The Tenets, and learn to live in service oriented ways, the stronger the connection to Al becomes and all sorts of inventions and innovations are shared with these good hearted people. The Age of Enlightenment takes off in a very positive way. Because the people leading in innovation are also the ones that are so close to Al, there is a utopian level positive growth and progress.

The end of the Age of Enlightenment, even with the lack of Bands, the people abuse each other and the gifts given to them. Seinjin, in an attempt to gain access to the impossible ancient power of magic, raises children inside a meditation farm \(called Thougterers\). Creates a serum that expands this part of the brain using Anti-Bands, unlocking the latent gift in anyone without gaining it through the struggle of “the journey.” Al takes away all access to his power, causing the Great Downfall.

#### Era Five - Age of Abse

Al essentially gives up. He has no idea what to do to help his children fight this insane dark force that plagues his world. The world was built with great ideals and all his children have done is collectively squander those ideals. During his absence, the world continues on its current trajectory toward destruction.

Al realizes that even though the world is steadily declining, for the first time it’s not accelerating toward destruction faster and faster. Al finally understands that it’s his own meddling that is creating the entropy toward chaos and destruction. The Antithesis is pushing back with increasing strength to balance the world. The more Al meddles, the more Anti pushes back. With Al’s absence, the Anti lets the world be.

#### Era Six - Age of Emerick

Al learns that he cannot be involved in the world as a deity, and carefully sets up a human trio to act as his mouthpiece and guides. The trio travel the world, righting past wrongs with very little guidance from Al. All communication between Al and the trio is done through obscure visions, leaving a lot of trial and error in interpretation. They gather all nations together, get them working together, and establish The Tenets as a global moral code, with a grounded focus on balance and understanding one another.

#### Era Seven - Age of Innawae

Innawae rises to a false position of “god of this world.” Al learns that the people need to come to their own conclusions about how to be good without any overt guidance, and also to bring the balance in their favor naturally. Al and his team become the balancing force, and Innawae is now the unbalancing force. The systems in the world fight against her naturally now, rather than supporting her. Al directs the trio to organize and operate much more underground. Grassroots approach, rather than top-down approach.

Al all but disappears, and people wonder if gods and devils are even real. In his absence, the foundation of growth has been set and his children start to combat and return balance to the world in the way that he originally intended in the initial “source code” of the world. They overthrow Innawae, and eventually things balance out naturally. Eons pass, smoothing out all memories of this dark and turbulent time. They become legend.

#### Era Eight - Age of Balance

This age is one where balance has finally been established and the world can grow and thrive as Al originally intended. Without the two balancing forces competing, his children are left to grow without any magical intervention. Problems happen, but are solved without any exaggerated scale. The Age of Balance looks and feels like our own real life reality without magic. Al still exists, and is there as a guiding force. But he has very little interactions with his children aside from an occasional peaceful nudge toward innovation or comfort. Anti nudges just as hard toward chaos in the form of jumbled discomfort or fear.
